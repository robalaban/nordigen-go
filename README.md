   Go bindings for Nordigen Openbanking API
 </p>

[Nordigen](http://nordigen.com) provides open-banking data, which allow you to get access to banking information programatically. I sugges you check them out if you're interested in anything related to open banking.

## Disclaimer

⚠️ The spec is __very__ much work in progress, and un-official.

## Overview

This server was generated by the [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

To see how to make this your own, look here: [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech)

### Generating the server from the spec

Make sure that `openapi-generator` is installed.

 ```sh
 brew install openapi-generator
 ```

Generating a client / server:

 ```shell
 openapi-generator generate -i api/openapi.yaml -g go-server
 ```

### Running the server
To run the server, follow these simple steps:

 ```
 go run main.go
 ```

To run the server in a docker container
 ```
 docker build --network=host -t openapi .
 ```

Once image is built use
 ```
 docker run --rm -it openapi
 ```
